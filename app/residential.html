                        Residential security services are a primary element of Primetime Protect​ive Services offered
                        services. We provide security to a wide range of residential communities including gated
                        communities, open-access communities, apartment complexes, and high-rise residential buildings.

                        While some clients require a elevated level of security visibility, others may prefer a much
                        lower security profile. Primetime Protective Services Account Managers work closely with
                        property management companies, property owners, and boards of directors to determine each
                        client’s security needs.
