                        Our Armed Executive Protection Agents (AEPA) are fully licensed under Primetime Protective
                        Services. They are experts in providing executive protection, security and secure transportation
                        for our clients. These experienced professionals are experts in planning, threat assessments,
                        crisis management, and providing emergency response.

                        Frequently referred to as bodyguards, our AEPA's draw from decades of experience in working as
                        law enforcement officers and military special operations soldiers.

                        We understand that professional protection calls for much more than surrounding a client with
                        well-trained agents; our agents rely on advance work and threat assessments that identify
                        potential risks therefore preventing an incident before it occurs.

                        Our AEPA are experienced with providing highly visible protection details for the wealthiest,
                        most powerful individuals and corporations in the world.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting Corporate Executives</h2>
                    <p>
                        Executives may require protection from workplace violence issues relating to layoffs,
                        terminations or disgruntled employees. Corporate heads may need to travel to threatening or
                        unstable environments. No matter the situation, PPS provides the solutions and experience to
                        provide reliable protection for CEO's, Board of Directors and other corporate leaders.

                        We can help you create security strategies and detailed plans to deter and reduce threats and
                        manage critical incidents. As needed, our Executive Protection Program can include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>Active Shooter Preparations and Response Training</h2>
                    <p>
                        Learn how to prepare for an active shooter situation: An active shooter is an individual
                        actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in
                        most cases, active shooters use firearm(s). Active shooter situations are unpredictable and
                        evolve rapidly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law enforcement is required to stop an
                        active shooting. Because active shooter situations are often over within 10 to 15 minutes,
                        before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared to deal with the
                        situation.

                        Learn how to help others after an active shooter situation: In many cases, victims require
                        someone to help stop the bleeding and that person might be you. Learn how to control or stop the
                        bleeding until help arrives.

                        PPS has a standard 2 to 4-hour interactive hands-on course for non-law enforcement/medical
                        personnel. This class helps the general public and people who have jobs that place them at a
                        more elevated risk to be involved in this type of event.

                        Customized law enforcement and first responder classes are also available to fit every budget
                        and timeframe.
