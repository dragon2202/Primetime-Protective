                        integration into the master plan. The master security plan will define the parameters for
                        policies, standards, processes, procedures, the design of the security organization, physical
                        security measures and high-level technical security requirements. Upon completion of creating a
                        master plan, we work with our clients to produce the technical security system user
                        requirements, conceptual and detailed security systems designs, and the appropriate
                        documentation to support procurement processes. Additionally, PPS delivers program management
                        services during the implementation phases including procurement support, site inspections and
