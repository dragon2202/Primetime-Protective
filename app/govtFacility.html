                    <p>
                        Providing a secure environment within a government building for employees as well as the public
                        poses a unique challenge for post 9/11 security provider. Primetime Protective Services realizes
                        that providing the proper amount of security for any government structure is a challenging
                        balance to achieve. With the tightening of budgets and increased responsibilities, your security
                        plan must be comprehensive and thorough in its approach if you are to provide an appropriate
                        level of security with public access.

                        Primetime Protective Services understands the vital importance of these types of buildings and
                        the essential role that they play. We have a full complement of experienced personnel which we
                        can assign according to the particular detail for which our services are required.

                    <h2>General Security Measures for Government Facilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Government buildings’ security can be faced with ​threats like bombings, sabotage, unlawful
                        entries and theft. Because of this, it is imperative for these buildings to have adequate
                        security measures in place. The first step is to have some basic guidelines in place, which can
                        drastically improve government security. OSSI is dedicated to helping society have safer and
                        more secure buildings, and government security is no exception. In an effort to help achieve our
                        goals, we have provided some security tips.
                    </p>

                                When deciding which security measures are best for your building, it’s best to consider
                                potential security threats. The security resources and policies selected should match
                                the potential government security threats at hand.

                                In most cases, terrorists, kidnappers, and thieves are the primary threats to government
                                security. To deter these individuals from entering these buildings, all main entrances
                                should be secured with key-card access systems. Security personnel should also have
                                metal detectors at all entrances, so that people and packages entering government
                                buildings can be monitored. All government building staff should have recent access
                                control badges for identification purposes, too. Finally, as a rule of thumb, only
                                authorized contractors should be allowed to come into government buildings using access
                                control badges.

                                The perimeter control systems should all be upgraded with the appropriate monitoring
                                devices. Examples of monitoring systems include closed circuit monitoring devices and
                                intercoms. All the keys of a government building should always be locked in a security
                                office where only authorized people should be allowed access.

                                Crisis communication systems should also be installed inside of all government
                                buildings. In a time of crisis, it’s essential key personnel have access to and
                                familiarity with these systems, so they can be used effectively. Duress alarms and
                                intercoms are often used during a crisis, but government buildings should always have a
                                backup communication system as an extra precaution.

                                In an effort to secure executive offices from outside surveillance, these offices should
                                be located in the inner sections of government buildings. The offices should also be
                                arranged in such a way that all unescorted visitors can be easily monitored. All
                                important papers and documents should be kept out of reach and away from unauthorized
                                people. Typically, these papers and documents should remain locked in secure cabinets,
                                with keys hidden in separate security offices.

                                To keep buildings free of congestion, all recycling and trash receptacles should be kept
                                out of walkways and emptied regularly. Doing so allows members of security to navigate
                                through these buildings free of difficulty during times of crisis.

                            <p>
                                To avoid any tampering, alarms should be used to protect all communication equipment.
                                Electrical closets and telephone lines are common targets for criminals, and so special
                                measures should surround these areas.

                                Government security is essential to the protection of these important buildings.
                                Practicing these security guidelines can help keep these entities more secure.
