                            <h4>Chairman Of The Board, President/ Chief Executive Officer</h4>
                            <p>

                                and implementing improvements for the logistical and operational inadequacy at many

                                experience conducting threat assessments, varied types of security operations and

                                security assessments, drafting security plans, conducting training programs, or managing

                            <h4>Board Member, Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel</h4>
                            <p>
                                David Chaves is responsible for the overall operations and business development of
                                Primetime Protective Services, with a full spectrum of services: Armed/Unarmed security
                                services including mobile patrol, executive protection as well as consulting
                                investigative services and more.

                                As the Chief Operating Officer, David has had success in creating meaningful
                                relationships with law enforcement agencies and clients nationwide. His original mission
                                of the company was to create an alliance with all local and state law enforcement
                                agencies with emphasis on providing unparalleled professional security services with a
                                wide range of service capabilities to clients. This standard has proven to be a
                                successful and desired model since joining Primetime Protective Services in 2018. Prior
                                to joining PPS, he was a senior FBI Official/Supervisory Special Agent assigned to the
                                New York Division for twenty years. He served as the securities fraud program manager
                                for the most visible securities cases prosecuted over the last decade including Bernie
                                Madoff, Martha Stewart, Martin Shkreli and many more. He is widely recognized as the
                                chief strategist in coordinating these complex white-collar investigations and for
                                infiltrating corrupt participants in the hedge fund industry through the use of
                                sophisticated techniques, undercover operations, and wire taps.

                                He is a securities fraud subject matter expert and lectures to audiences around the
                                world on securities fraud, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), compliance/regulation,
                                best practices, leadership, and cyber threats to the financial industry. David has led
                                delegations in foreign countries on behalf of FBI and State Department to assist judges
                                and prosecutors on “rule of law” and protection of fundamental human rights. Prior to
                                joining the FBI, he became the youngest Detective Sergeant in the State of Massachusetts
                                and the first policeman to become an attorney and member of the Massachusetts Bar. He
                                had a civil litigation practice in MA.

                                David is regularly sought by print, online, and television media for his unique insight
                                on a broad spectrum of topics. As an FBI Agent, he also worked closely with financial
                                industry executives and legal teams to foster a culture of compliance, leadership, and
                                responsibility.
